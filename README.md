# Adventure Works  

This repository contains the solution developed for the Analytics Engineering Certification by Indicium.  

## Context  

Adventure Works (AW), a fast-growing bicycle manufacturer, set out to leverage data as a strategic asset to sustain its expansion and strengthen its competitive advantage.  

To ensure trust in analytics outputs, the CEO required all results to reconcile with audited financial statements, including a specific validation test for gross sales in 2011.  
This project therefore became more than just a technical challenge: it was a strategic proof of how modern analytics can drive smarter business decisions.  

## Objective  

The main objective of this project is to build a robust and scalable analytics platform for Adventure Works. This involves:  

- **Modern Analytics Stack Implementation** → Building an end-to-end data pipeline to support a data-driven culture.  
- **Data Transformation** → Converting raw transactional data into an analytical structure through dimensional modeling.  
- **Technical Expertise** → Applying SQL, dbt and BI tools to design and deliver the solution.  
- **Data Quality & Trust** → Implementing automated validation and quality tests to guarantee the accuracy and reliability of all analytics outputs.  
- **Actionable Insights** → Delivering interactive dashboards to answer key business questions.  

## Methodology & Implementation  

The project followed a structured, phased approach to ensure data integrity and reliable delivery:  

1. **Dimensional Modeling** → Designing a star schema with a central sales fact table supported by dimension tables for a holistic business view.  
2. **Data Transformation with dbt** → Developing staging, intermediate and marts models following best practices.  
3. **Data Quality & Testing** → Implementing automated tests in dbt, including the specific validation of gross sales in 2011.  
4. **Data Visualization** → Building interactive Power BI dashboards to analyze sales performance and answer key business questions.  

## Tech Stack  

The solution is built on a modern, cloud-based analytics stack for performance and scalability:  

- **SQL** → Querying and data validation.  
- **dbt** → Data modeling, transformation, testing, and documentation.  
- **Snowflake** → Cloud data warehouse for scalability and performance.  
- **Power BI** → Interactive dashboards and visualization.  
- **GitHub** → Version control and collaboration.
